{"name":"Un/Cover","tagline":"A Multi-Purpose Virtual Geocaching and Bulletin App","body":"### What is Un/Cover?\r\nUn/Cover is a multi-purpose virtual geocaching and bulletin app designed to be used for social and business purposes. Have you ever wanted to see events and promotions around you in real time using a map? Have you ever needed to promote your business in a cost efficient manner? Whether your event or promotion is impromptu or well-planned ahead of time, Un/Cover allows you to spread the word in an intuitive and paperless manner!\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nUn/Cover works by allowing users to place bulletins, referenced as \"neocaches\" in the app, in a virtual space that overlays the real world. These bulletins are viewable through our Google Maps app interface. Each neocache has two ranges specified by the user, one range that allows users to partially view the neocache by it's title and author, and a second, smaller range that allows users to see the neocache and all of its contents. These two ranges combine to generate both digital and physical activity centered around your event. \r\n\r\n### What are you waiting on?\r\n[Try the app out now on Google Play!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CS499.btsmith.uncover)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
